Custom Python Data Structures

A collection of efficient, production-ready data structures implemented from scratch in Python. This project demonstrates core computer science concepts with practical, real-world applications.

Includes:
- LRU Cache - O(1) get/put operations using OrderedDict and doubly-linked list implementations. Perfect for caching API responses, database queries, and expensive computations.

- Priority Task Queue - Min-heap based task scheduler with priority management. Ideal for job scheduling, event handling, and system maintenance tasks.

- Trie (Prefix Tree) - Efficient autocomplete system with frequency-based ranking. Supports fast prefix searches for search suggestions, spell checking, and text prediction.

Each implementation includes comprehensive test suites, performance benchmarks, and real-world usage examples. Built to reinforce understanding of time/space complexity, algorithm design, and practical software engineering patterns.

Great for learning data structures, technical interview preparation, or integrating into larger projects.
